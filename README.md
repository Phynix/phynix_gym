# phynix-gym
Environments to train reinforcement learning agents to minimize a negative log-likelihood function.

Currently contains one environment, `Minimize1DSimple` which takes a couple of configuration arguments and adheres to the openai `gym` API. It can also be instantiated with  `gym.make("minimize-1d-simple-v0").
